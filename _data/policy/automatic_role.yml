super_id: 
description: "\nSome [Roles](#reference/role) are created automatically by a containing
  record. \n        \nThese roles are accessed by using the `automatic-role`\ntype,
  which identifies the containing record (e.g. a Layer), and the name of the automatic
  role (e.g. `use_host`).\n\nThe automatic roles of a Layer are:\n\n* **use_host**,
  for allowing SSH access to each host as the `users` primary group.\n* **admin_host**,
  for allowing SSH access to each host as the `conjurers` primary group.\n* **observe**,
  for `read` privileges on the hosts.\n"
