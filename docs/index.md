# Conjur is the security service for modern infrastructure:

### Machine Identity

Conjur provides encrypted, access controlled, and audited management of infrastructure secrets such as database passwords, SSL certificates and keys, SSH keys, and cloud credentials.


### Secrets Vault

Conjur provides encrypted, access controlled, and audited management of infrastructure secrets such as database passwords, SSL certificates and keys, SSH keys, and cloud credentials.


### Authentication & Administration
At its core, the Conjur platform is designed to address the question of:  “Where does identity come from?”  That is, how does a newly created VM, container, or application get its identity and begin accessing resources based on authorization policies with all activity logged? How are developers, IT, and system administrators assigned privileges to new infrastructure?

### Integrations with Modern Development Tools
Conjur integrates with your favorite DevOps and cloud tools to keep you working quickly and securely
