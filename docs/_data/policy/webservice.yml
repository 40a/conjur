  Represents a web service endpoint, typically an HTTP(S) service.

  Permission grants are straightforward: an input
  HTTP request path is mapped to a webservice resource id. The HTTP
  method is mapped to an RBAC privilege. A permission check is
  performed, according to the following transaction:

  * **role** client incoming role on the HTTP request. The client can be obtained from an Authorization header (e.g. signed
    access token), or from the subject name of an SSL client certificate.
  * **privilege** `read`, `update`, or `delete` according to HTTP verb
  * **resource** web service resource id
