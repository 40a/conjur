description: "\nMove a Role or Resource to the attic.\n\nWhen you no longer need a
  role or resource in Conjur, you `retire` it.\nThis is different than deleting it.
  When you retire an item, all of\nits memberships and privileges are revoked and
  its ownership is\ntransferred to the `attic` user. This is a special user in Conjur
  that\nis created when you first bootstrap your Conjur endpoint. By\nretiring rather
  than deleting items, the integrity of the immutable\naudit log is preserved.\n\nYou
  can unretire items by logging in as the\n'attic' user and transferring their ownership
  to another role. The\n'attic' user's API key is stored as a variable in Conjur at\n`conjur/users/attic/api-key`.
  It is owned by the 'security_admin'\ngroup. "
