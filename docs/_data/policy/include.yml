description: "\nIncludes the contents of another policy file.\n\nBy using this feature,
  policies for an entire organization can be\ndefined in one source repository, and
  then unified by a top-level\n\"Conjurfile\".\n\nAttributes:\n\n* **file** path to
  the included policy file, relative to the including policy file.\n    This is the
  default attribute, so it can be specified in shorthand form as:\n    `- !include
  the-policy.yml`\n\nIncluded policies inherit the namespace and owner of the enclosing\ncontext.
  To include a policy with a different namespace and owner,\nfirst define an enclosing
  policy record with the following attributes:\n    \n* **id** the name which is appended
  to the current namespace\n* **owner** the desired owner\n    \nThen, within the
  body of that policy, include the additional \npolicy files.\n"
example: "\n- !include groups.yml\n    \n- !policy\n  id: ops\n  owner: !group operations\n
  \ body:\n  - !include jenkins-master.yml\n  - !include ansible.yml\n  - !include
  openvpn.yml\n"
