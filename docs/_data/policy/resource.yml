  Create a custom Resource.

  Resources are the entities on which permissions are defined. A
  resource id is an arbitrary, unique string which identifies the
  protected asset.

  Examples: database password, virtual machine or
  server (for SSH access management), web service endpoint

  Any Conjur resource can be annotated with a key-value pair. This
  makes organization and discovery easier since annotations can be
  searched on and are shown in the Conjur UI. Automation workflows
  like rotation and expiration are based on annotations.

  Typically, resources are not defined directly.
  Rather, records that behave as resources, such as Users, Groups,
  Hosts, Layers, Variables and Webservices are used instead.
