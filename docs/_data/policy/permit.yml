description: "\nGive privileges on a resource to a role.\n\nOnce a privilege is given,
  permission checks performed by the role\nwill return `true`.\n\nNote that permissions
  are not \"inherited\" by any mechanism such as glob \nexpressions on resource ids;
  each privilege must be \nexplicitly given on each resource. Inheritance of privileges
  only happens through\nrole grants. Role-based access control\nis explicit in this
  way to avoid unintendend side-effects from the way that \nresources are named.\n"
example: "\n- !layer prod/app\n        \n- !variable prod/database/password\n        \n-
  !permit\n  role: !layer prod/app\n  privileges: [ read, execute ]\n  resource: !variable
  prod/database/password\n"
