description: "\nRemove a [Role](#reference/role) grant. (contrast: [Grant](#reference/grant))\n\nSome
  `revoke` operations have additional semantics beyond the role revocation:\n        \n*
  When a Layer is revoked from a Host, the automatic roles on the Layer are denied
  their\n    privileges on the Host. Specifically, the `observe` role is denied `read`
  privilege,\n    `use_host` is denied `execute`, and `admin_host` is denied `update`.\n\nSee
  also: [role-based access control guide](/key_concepts/rbac.html).\n"
