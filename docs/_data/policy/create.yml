description: "\nCreate a record of any type.\n\nA record can be a [Role](#reference/role)
  or a [Resource](#reference/resource).\n\nCreating records can be done explicitly
  using this node type, or\nimplicitly. Examples of both are given immediately below.\n
  \   \nWhen a record is created explicitly, it's an error if the record already exists.\nWhen
  a record is created implicitly, the record will be found-or-created, and its\nstate
  (owner, fields and annotations) will be updated to match the policy declaration.\n"
