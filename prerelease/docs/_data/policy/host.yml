  \       \nHosts defined in a policy are generally long-lasting hosts, and assigned
  to a\nlayer through a `!grant` entitlement. Assignment to layers is the primary
  way\nfor hosts to get privileges, and also the primary way that users obtain access
  to hosts.\n"
example: "\n- !host\n  id: www-01.home.cern\n  annotations:\n    description: Hypertext
  web server\n        \n- !grant\n  role: !layer webservers\n  member: !host www-01.cern.org\n"
