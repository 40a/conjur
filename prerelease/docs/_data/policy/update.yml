description: "\nMake explicit changes to an existing record's attributes and/or annotations.\n\nFor
  example, you can change annotations on a [Resource](#reference/resource), or the
  `uidnumber` of a [User](#reference/user).\n    \nGenerally, Update is not used explicitly.
  Instead, an update is performed by the create-or-replace behavior of\nstatements
  such as User, Group, Host, Layer, etc.\n"
